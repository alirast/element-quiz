# element-quiz
Element quiz is a small study-project that was made with the help of the tutorial in Xcode'12 Explorations book by Apple Education. 

Element quiz is an app that allows users who can be students to revise some information or to learn it better. There're two modes in this app: flashcards and quiz. In flashcards-mode users can't see their score as well as in quiz-mode.
